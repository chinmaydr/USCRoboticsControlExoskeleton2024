# Using Series Elastic Actuators for Knee Exoskeletons
## Motivation
- **To provide aid to those without fully functioning knees to perform basic tasks**
  - **Elderly or disabled with non-funtioning or partially functioning knees**
    - **As a possible extension, it could also be used for soldiers or hikers who get tired walking long distances or carrying heavy loads**
  - **To aid in tasks like walking, kneeling, sitting, standing, or squatting**
  - **Make exoskeletons more safe and adaptable by using compliant mechanisms over rigid ones**
    - **Also more accessible to the general public as compliant mechanisms generally cost less**

## Background
- **Flexsea-Execute: advanced motion controller for wearable robotic applications**
  - **Journal: MIT Media Lab Research-Publications: Biomechanics (July 8, 2016)**
  - **Objective: Provide advanced motion microcontrollers for robotic prosthetics To improve quality of life and obstacles of wearable robots**
  - **Using Flexible SEA instead of common motor to move lower limb exoskeleton**
  - **Communication software connects to nervous system signals tells FlexSEA how/when move**
  - **Similar to how human body bends and moves could be used to revolutionize exterior movement supports for humans**
  - ** Used this Article as a baseline for how we could model our own simulation in Simulink**
