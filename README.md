# Using Elastic Actuators for Knee Exoskeletons
## Motivation
- To provide aid to those without fully functioning knees to perform basic tasks

  - Elderly or disabled with non-funtioning or partially functioning knees
    - As a possible extension, it could also be used for soldiers or hikers who get tired walking long distances or carrying heavy loads
  - To aid in tasks like walking, kneeling, sitting, standing, or squatting
  - Make exoskeletons more safe and adaptable by using compliant mechanisms over rigid ones
    - Also more accessible to the general public as compliant mechanisms generally cost less
